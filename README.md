# Dungeons & Dragons 5ed. Encounter Creator

##Synopsis
I wanted to learn the React framework, so I build a simple SPA that helps Dungeons & Dragons DMs design a combat encounter.

##Instructions to run the app
First run "npm install" to install the dependencies required.
Then go to the main folder and type "gulp"

##Instructions to use the app
First, fill in the number of characters in your party and their level. If characters in your party are at different levels, add multiple rows and include each group of characters with the same level in their own row.

*For example, if you have four first-level characters, type 4 in number, and 1 in level. If you have three seventh-level characters and one eighth-level, type 3 in number, 7 in level, add a second row, and add 1 in number and 8 in level.*

Second, fill in the number of monsters and the amount of XP that each one gives in a similar manner. 

Finally, press **How Hard Is This Fight Going To Be?**  to get a difficulty rating for the encounter given your party.

#Inspiration
I took the general concept and layout of this from the site: *http://dhmholley.co.uk/encounter-calculator-5th/*. Thanks for helping with the encounter calculations! (This site uses jQuery to basically do the same thing. Like I said, I wanted to teach myself React so having a finished product to compare to was useful)
